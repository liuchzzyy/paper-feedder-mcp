# AGENTS.md

Repository-level collaboration notes for contributors and coding agents.

## Scope

- Applies to the entire repository.
- Follow existing code style and keep changes minimal and task-focused.

## Configuration and Secrets

- Never commit real API keys or tokens.
- Keep `.env` local only; use `.env.example` for placeholders.
- For GitHub Actions, store credentials in repository secrets (not in workflow YAML).

## CLI Workflow Conventions

- Recommended order: `fetch -> filter -> enrich -> export`.
- Do not export directly from fetched input (`fetched_papers.json` / legacy `raw.json`) unless intentionally bypassing filtering.
- For Zotero exports, prefer `TARGET_COLLECTION` or `--collection`.

## Gmail Pipeline Notes

- `GMAIL_SENDER_FILTER` is optional; if set too narrowly, fetch may return `0`.
- When mailbox has no matching alerts, zero fetched papers is expected behavior.

## Validation

- Run targeted tests for touched areas before finalizing:
  - `uv run pytest tests/unit/test_cli.py tests/unit/test_config.py`
  - Add `tests/unit/test_gmail_source.py` when changing Gmail behavior.
