    "abstract": "Device‐level zinc batteries are energy‐limited by the mass/volume of inactive components, while lean‐electrolyte operation triggers interfacial water depletion and unstable kinetics. Here we elucidate lean‐failure mechanisms and develop a COF@PAN functional separator that regulates hydrogen‐bonding networks to manage water activity and accelerate infiltration, enabling high‐energy, durable Zn pouch cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nDespite zinc metal batteries offering attractions such as natural abundance, safety, and sustainability, their widespread adoption is hindered by a critical, underexplored limitation: intrinsically low device‐level energy density. While previous research has prioritized stabilizing zinc anodes to suppress dendrites, practical energy densities remain constrained by excessive inactive components (separators, electrolytes) that dominate device mass and volume. Conventional strategies, such as cell upscaling, exacerbate this issue by necessitating surplus electrolyte, leading to inflated electrolyte to capacity ratios (> 10 g Ah−1) and poor specific/volumetric energy metrics (e.g., ∼5 Wh kg−1). Current reporting practices, focusing on Ah or idealized active‐material metrics, further obscure true performance, masking the urgent need for holistic design innovations. Crucially, lean‐electrolyte operation, essential for high energy density, introduces unaddressed challenges like interfacial water depletion and activity mismanagement. This work bridges this gap by systematically unraveling failure mechanisms under lean conditions and pioneering a functional separator that optimizes water management and ion transport. By redefining hydrogen‐bonding networks to mitigate water consumption and enable rapid infiltration, the developed COF@PAN separator achieves unprecedented energy densities (54.0 Wh kg−1, 185.3 Wh L−1) and cycle stability (over 800 cycles) in practical pouch cells. These insights and designs advance Zn metal batteries beyond lab‐scale promises, positioning them as viable contenders for energy‐dense, real‐world applications.",

    "abstract": "A type of biogel electrolytes with a hierarchical‐heterogeneous structure is developed. Benefitting from the improved interfacial contact and enhanced toughness by heating treatment, this biogel electrolyte facilitates a Zn2+ 3D diffusion and suppresses dendrite Zn growth to regulate Zn anode interfacial compatibility, thereby achieving leading performance in hybrid capacitors and excellent outdoor applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nGel electrolytes are high‐priority materials for solid‐state Zn‐ion hybrid capacitors, characterized by high ionic conductivity and intrinsic mechanical flexibility. However, because the existing gel electrolytes are relatively soft and do not contact intimately with rigid Zn anodes, they have inferior interfacial compatibility with Zn anodes, leading to device degradation. Here we develop a class of biogel electrolytes by in situ crystallizing gelatin triple helix units from the alginate polymer domain to form a unique hierarchical‐heterogeneous structure. The biogel electrolyte demonstrates combined advantages of high toughness, temperature‐triggered adhesion, high Zn2+ transference number and temperature‐independent ionic conductivity. These notable features favor Zn2+ 3D diffusion and accommodate zinc anode volume changes, thus enabling the symmetric Zn||Zn cell to highlight a balance among high current density, high areal capacity and prolonged cycling life. Moreover, the assembled zinc||activated carbon hybrid capacitor performs exceptional capacitive behavior and stable operation across the temperature range from 25°C to –40°C, delivering competitive energy density of 125.5 Wh kg−1 with high capacity retention of 97.1% over 10 000 cycles even at −40°C. Finally, system‐level demonstration based on the resulting hybrid capacitors can power portable electronics in a power cable‐free manner, validating applicability for green power sources in outdoor activities.",

The entropy‐stabilized HES forms a unique wurtzite/zincblende biphasic structure, creating abundant grain boundaries and synergistic active sites. Electrochemical studies demonstrate that the synergistic battery exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance and cycling stability. Machine learning (ML) models were established to predict electrochemical behavior under various operating conditions.

    "abstract": "A dendrite‐free zinc anode is realized via a Ti4+‐etched micro‐stepped surface that induces directional 2D zinc diffusion. Zinc ions migrate orderly along step boundaries, enabling highly uniform stripping and deposition. As a result, cells paired with V2O5 or iodine cathodes exhibit outstanding electrochemical performances, offering new mechanistic insights for long‐life aqueous zinc ion batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAqueous zinc batteries have garnered significant attention owing to their low cost, high intrinsic safety, and environmental friendliness. However, their practical application is still hindered by poor cycling stability, primarily caused by uncontrolled Zn dendrite growth. Conventional strategies to suppress dendrites generally aim to convert undesired 2D diffusion, which favors dendrite formation, into 3D diffusion to promote uniform Zn deposition. In contrast, this study reports a dendrite‐free Zn plating behavior achieved through directional 2D diffusion enabled by a micro‐terraced surface, which is achieved by a Ti4+‐etching strategy. Unlike conventional 2D diffusion, where Zn atoms aggregate and form dendrites, on the micro‐terraced surface Zn atoms rapidly and orderly migrate along the terraces toward their intersection boundaries, resulting in uniform, dendrite‐free plating. The micro‐terraced Zn anodes deliver exceptional cycling stability over 6250 cycles at 5 mA cm−2/1 mAh cm−2. When paired with I2 cathode, the full cells achieve above 83.4% capacity retention and average Coulombic efficiencies of 99.89% over 5000 cycles at 1.5 A g−1. This work provides mechanistic insights into Zn deposition and offers a new design paradigm for developing high‐stability energy storage systems.",

Herein, inspired by the biological regulation of inflammatory stress, sulfated polysaccharides are proposed as sustainable electrolyte additives. Specifically, dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) enables durable Zn (100) plating/stripping and balanced interfacial kinetics. The high‐density continuously grafted ─SO3− bonds in DSS can rebuild Zn2+ solvation structure and construct a robust interfacial layer to mitigate parasitic reaction and dendrite formation. Preferred absorption of DSS on (100) facet through ─SO3− bonds restrict Zn growth along this facet and facilitate Zn2+ diffusion from adjacent (002)/(101) facets, ultimately exposing Zn (100) texture. Multiple ─SO3− bonds enable fast desolvation and ionic transport kinetics, and steric hindrance of DSS ensures moderated Zn2+ reduction kinetics, synergistically establishing a kinetics‐balanced interface for durable Zn (100) deposition. Consequently, the DSS‐modified electrolyte achieves exceptional cycling stability (10400 h at 1 mA cm−2) and high‐rate capability (1500 h at 20 mA cm−2) for (100)‐oriented Zn anodes. The broad compatibility with various cathodes underscores the practical promise of this strategy.

However, the mechanism for precise targeted design of solvation structures remains unclear. This study employs a space‐confined regulation strategy through carbon chain shortening and amino migration to unveil the correlation between molecular conformation evolution and solvent sheath design. The findings demonstrate that carbon chain shortening and amino migration synergistically induce steric hindrance decrement, driving the transition from monopolar configuration to bisolvation‐sheath‐bichelation (BSB) configuration. The BSB structure facilitates Zn2+ migration through electrostatic repulsion induced by dual Zn2+ coordination, while enhancing Zn deposition/stripping kinetics via competitive anion desolvation. As a result, the Zn//Zn symmetric cell exhibits decent rate capability up to 30 mA cm−2 and remarkable stability for 3600 hours under 5 mA cm−2 and 5 mAh cm−2. Moreover, the BSB structure has shown substantial enhancement in the cycling stability of Zn//V2O5 cells with 80% capacity retention after 1800 cycles at 2 A g−1.

Nevertheless, their widespread commercialization is hindered by critical challenges, particularly the limited Zn reversibility caused by persistent electrolyte decomposition and uncontrolled dendritic growth. In this study, we propose a chemical strategy involving nucleophilic ethoxide ions, generated via ethanol deprotonation, to induce defluorination of the trifluoromethanesulfonate anion. This approach facilitates the in situ formation of a fluorinated protective interphase on the Zn anode surface. The engineered interphase exhibits remarkable mechanical robustness, as demonstrated by substantially improved Zn Coulombic efficiency at both high and low current densities as well as high Zn utilization rates. Furthermore, this surface modification strategy enables the Zn0.25V2O5/Zn powder batteries to achieve unprecedented cycling stability, including prolonged operation under demanding low N/P ratio conditions (<2:1) and high areal capacity (>2 mAh cm−2).",

Consequently, the cells with SABi/U‐LMO exhibit long‐term duration and stabilize high‐capacity retention of nearly 100% under the low temperature of −20 °C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nDendrite‐free Zn metal anodes with robust interface are highly desired for the practical application of aqueous zinc‐metal based batteries (AZMBs), while their stability is hindered by the untoward [Zn(H2O)6]2+ desolvation and succedent deposition with dissatisfactory kinetic barriers, especially under low‐temperature environment. Herein, a self‐cascade catalytic strategy on accelerating interfacial desolvation and optimizing diffusion is proposed by designing an atomically dispersed Bi within the deficient LaMnO3.15 perovskite (SABi/U‐LMO) layer on Zn anode. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the d‐band center and nonbonding state near the Fermi level of SABi/U‐LMO alleviate the corrosion of H2O and accelerate the dissociation of Zn2+─H2O bond by promoting the rapid filling of the empty 4s orbital of the Zn2+, as revealed by electrochemical and spectroscopic results. Meanwhile, the redistribution of electric field with SABi/U‐LMO realizes the delocalization and lateral growth of Zn atoms. Consequently, the cells with SABi/U‐LMO render an impressive lifetime up to 5000 h at 1 mA cm−2 as well as a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.59% over 2000 cycles under 0 °C. Full cell also stabilizes the capacity retention of ∼100% after 900 cycles at 1 A g−1 under −20 °C, verifying the feasibility of self‐cascade catalysis in realizing high‐performance AZMBs.",

    "abstract": "A synergistic network featuring strong Zn2+ coordination anchors and flexible hydrogen‐bond bridges is designed to reconcile the intrinsic trade‐off between anti‐freezing and self‐healing properties in zinc‐ion batteries, while robust in situ interfacial polymerization ensures intimate electrode contact. The electrolyte remains unfrozen at −75°C, self‐heals within 10 min at −20°C, and suppresses parasitic reactions via Zn2+ solvation sheath reconstruction. Batteries exhibit 97.0% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 5 A g−1 over an 80°C temperature range.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe commercialization of aqueous zinc‐ion batteries is hampered by a fundamental paradox: electrolytes with anti‐freezing properties typically lack self‐healing capability, and vice versa. Herein, we decouple this trade‐off through the ingenious design of a synergistic network within a eutectogel electrolyte. This network is governed by strong Zn2+ coordination acting as rigid anchors, coupled with a dynamic quaternary hydrogen‐bond (HB) network involving glycerol, ClO4−, water, and polyacrylamide serving as flexible bridges. In this configuration, the strong Zn2+ coordination and dense hydrogen bonds synergistically inhibit ice lattice formation to ensure anti‐freezing, while the reversible hydrogen bonds enable dynamic molecular reconfiguration for self‐healing. The resulting gel remains ice‐free at −75°C and self‐heals within 10 min even at −20°C. Concurrently, this unique structure reconstructs the Zn2+ solvation sheath, significantly reducing the water coordination number from 3.65 to 2.62, which effectively suppresses water‐induced parasitic reactions. Coupled with robust in situ interfacial engineering, the assembled battery exhibits a high specific capacity and exceptional cycling stability (97.0% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 5 A g−1) over a wide temperature range of 80°C (−20°C–60°C). This work not only provides a high‐performance electrolyte for practical zinc batteries but also establishes an innovative design paradigm for resolving property conflicts in advanced functional materials.",

    "abstract": "Aqueous zinc‐ion batteries suffer from rapid decay under practical conditions due to bilateral Zn2+/Mn2+ ionic crosstalk, a system‐level failure mechanism. We develop a hierarchical fluorinated polymer separator that regulates ion fluxes and stabilizes both electrodes simultaneously. This strategy enables extended cycle life while maintaining capacity, establishing ion flux regulation as a key design principle for durable zinc‐based energy storage systems. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAqueous Zn//MnO2 batteries hold significant promise for safe and cost‐effective large‐scale energy storage, yet their practical deployment is hindered by rapid performance degradation. Here, we identify bilateral ionic crosstalk, a previously overlooked failure mechanism driven by active ion, as a root cause of electrode degradation. We demonstrate that excess Zn2+ migrating from the anode induces irreversible phase transitions at the MnO2 cathode, forming electrochemically inert Znx(MnO2)y phase (ZMO sclerosis). Concurrently, dissolved Mn2+ from the cathode exacerbates corrosion and dendrite growth on the Zn anode. To mitigate this crosstalk, we design a hierarchical fluorinated polymer separator (HFPS). Such HFPS enables selective cation coordination and guides ion transport, achieving simultaneous regulation of Zn2+ and Mn2+ fluxes. This targeted regulation effectively mitigates ionic crosstalk and stabilizes both electrodes. Batteries employing the HFPS exhibit exceptional cycling stability, retaining 97% capacity after 1,000 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 with stable operation exceeding 500 h. This performance represents a 54% lifespan enhancement over state‐of‐the‐art aqueous counterparts. Our work provides a fundamental mechanistic understanding of active‐ion‐induced failure and establishes ion flux regulation as a universal design strategy for durable aqueous zinc‐ion batteries.",

This work introduces a novel hygroscopic vanadium metal–organic framework (V‐MOF) as a multifunctional protective layer to achieve an outstanding Zn anode. The as‐fabricated battery can remain stable and high performance with high DOD of 85.5% and fast discharging rate of 50 mAh/cm2.

In addition, the V‐MOF coating optimized the electrical field, inhibited the cracks, and reduced the Zn dendrite formation even at a high rate of 50 mAh/cm2, due to the construction of electrolyte‐philic and smooth surface. Consequently, the hygroscopic Zn/V‐MOF symmetrical cells achieve exceptional performance over 1000 h under 50 mA/cm2 (50 mAh/cm2) with 85.5% DOD.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a quantitative water‐speciation strategy that unveils and regulates distinct molecular environments in electrolytes, establishing composition‐microstructure‐property relationships that guide rational solvent design. Precise tuning of water activity enables fast ion transport and stabilization of four‐electron redox pathways, thereby suppressing parasitic reactions and delivering high‐capacity, durable aqueous Zn‐I2 batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nWater governs both reactivity and transport in aqueous batteries, yet the occurrence of distinct free, coordinated, and network‐bound states complicates electrolyte design. Here, a quantitative water‐speciation identification (QWSI) strategy is established to resolve and quantify water populations and to correlate composition with microstructure and function. Aqueous Zn‐I2 batteries are employed as a model system owing to the high sensitivity of capacity to water‐state distributions. Eliminating free water stabilizes electrophilic iodine species and activates the I2/2I+ couple to realize a four‐electron conversion that doubles capacity, whereas driving water content too low depletes coordinated and network‐bound water, slows ion transport, and ultimately compromises capacity. The QWSI strategy pinpoints a critical composition at which water resides within hydrogen‐bond networks and cation solvation shells, with no detectable bulk‐like free water. Electrolytes formulated at this composition sustain four‐electron conversion while maintaining high ionic conductivity, reconciling activation of four‐electron conversion with ion transport. Consequently, the Zn//I2 cells deliver distinct two‐plateau profiles and high reversibility, enabling an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% and a specific capacity of 309.1 mAh·g−1. These findings define molecular control of water‐state distributions as a design principle, while the QWSI strategy provides quantitative descriptors for predictive control of solvation and reactivity across aqueous electrochemistry.",

Herein, a representative porous organic cage (POC), namely CC3, is proposed as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (ASEI) through a facile electrospray technique. Owing to the characteristic internal cavities, 3D interpenetrated channels, partial disorder enhanced porosity, zincophilicity, and solution processability, the CC3‐ASEI is not only conducive to enable rapid desolvation and migration of Zn2+ through ASEI, but also affords uniform Zn2+ flux and oriented Zn deposition, thus effectively suppressing dendrite growth and parasitic reactions. As a result, the CC3‐ASEI bestows an outstanding Coulombic efficiency of 99.86% for 5000 cycles in the Zn||Ti asymmetric cell and remarkably stable Zn plating/stripping over 7100 h in the Zn||Zn symmetric cell. Besides, the implementation of this CC3‐ASEI also markedly improves the rate capability and cycling stability of AZBs with various cathodes, highlighting the great potential of employing POCs to promote the practical application of AZBs.",

The Sn alloy atoms preferentially segregate at heteroatom concentrated grain boundaries, enhancing corrosion capability and inhibiting dendrite growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nBoth coating on Zn foil anode and solid electrolyte interphases engineered via electrolyte modification still face stability challenges under high current densities for aqueous Zn‐ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, high‐current‐density stable Zn‐alloy anode with a large electrode size of 200 × 200 × 0.1 mm3 is developed. The results indicate that Sn alloy atoms preferentially segregate at heteroatom‐concentrated grain boundaries and the alloy anode has a preferred orientation along the (002) plane during cycling, inhibiting dendrite growth and enhancing corrosion capability. These integrated merits enable a long lifespan for symmetric batteries even at 40 mA cm−2 with 20 mAh cm−2, and an excellent cycling stability for both coin‐ and pouch‐type batteries at 2 A g−1. This work provides an in‐depth understanding of the effect of alloy element on Zn anode stability and meanwhile paves the way for scalable production and practical application of AZIBs.",

    "abstract": "Successfully designed a multifunctional HCZ hydrogel electrolyte that can simultaneously address the challenges related to the Zn anode and I2 cathode in Zn‖I2 batteries, achieving ultralong stability over a wide temperature range. It has the potential to serve as an advanced electrolyte candidate for high‐performance AZIBs, promoting the practical application of AZIBs under extreme temperature conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAqueous zinc–iodine batteries (AZIBs) possess significant potential for energy storage owing to their high theoretical capacity and remarkable cycling stability. Nevertheless, their practical deployment is severely constrained by a shortened life resulting from uncontrollable parasitic reactions and poor temperature adaptability. Herein, we design a multifunctional dual‐network hydrogel electrolyte PHEAA‐CMC‐ Zn(CF3SO3)2 (HCZ) composed of rigid carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and flexible poly (N‐hydroxyethyl acrylamide) (PHEAA) featuring abundant dynamic intra/intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Intriguingly, the rich hydrophilic groups in the electrolyte form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, effectively regulating water‐induced side reactions at the electrode–electrolyte interfaces and enabling excellent temperature tolerance across a wide range from −30°C to 50°C. Moreover, the polar amide groups and oxygen‐containing functionalities within the hydrogel can coordinate with Zn2+ to promote Zn2+ migration at the anode, while simultaneously providing electrostatic adsorption of polyiodide species to mitigate the shuttle effect at the cathode. Therefore, Zn‖Zn symmetric cells equipped with this engineered electrolyte exhibit prolonged cycling stability exceeding 3000 h at both 20 and −30°C. Moreover, AZIBs with this hydrogel deliver long‐term cycling durability over 20 000 cycles at −30°C and 30 000 cycles at 50°C. This electrolyte provides new insights for AZIBs capable of stable operation across broad temperature.",

    "abstract": "In this work, 3‐(amidinothio)‐1‐propanesulfonic acid are deployed as an additive to mimic the directional cargo delivery of kinesins. Specifically, the iso‐thiourea groups of the additive adsorb and anchor onto Zn(002) planes, while sulfonic acid groups are responsible for capturing Zn2+ ions to facilitate their deposition. The adaptive “anchor‐capture” mechanism results in a highly textured and reversible Zn anode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nThe practical implementation of zinc (Zn) metal electrode in rechargeable aqueous batteries remains hindered by uncontrolled dendrite formation and parasitic side reactions, primarily stemming from unregulated ion transport and high water activity. Inspired by directional cargo‐transport function of kinesins, here a mimetic ion director, represented by 3‐(amidinothio)‐1‐propanesulfonic acid (APSA), is deployed to regulate Zn deposition and suppress side reactions. When added into the electrolyte, the iso‐thiourea groups of APSA selectively anchor to Zn(002) facets, mimicking microtubule‐binding domain of kinesin, while the sulfonic acid groups locally concentrate Zn2+ ions near the anchored sites, resembling cargo‐binding domains. This bio‐inspired “anchor‐capture” synergy enables dynamic, self‐adaptive regulation of Zn2+ ion flux, thereby guiding oriented Zn deposition and suppressing dendrite formation. Meanwhile, APSA reduces both interfacial and bulk water activity, thus mitigating side reactions. As a result, the novel bio‐inspired electrolyte dramatically extends the cycle life of aqueous Zn batteries. Remarkably, a Zn//NaV3O8·1.5H2O full battery comprising of an ultrathin Zn anode (20 µm) and a low N/P ratio (≈6) retains 93.40% of capacity after 400 cycles (over 600 h). This work provides a novel biomimetic ion transport regulation strategy that enables directional metal deposition, offering a transformative pathway toward highly stable and reversible metal batteries.",

    "abstract": "A dual‐descriptor screening strategy based on molecular polarizability and surface energy is proposed to guide the rational design of organic electrolyte additives. Additives featuring low polarizability and surface energy matched to ZnSO4 induce a compact, water‐deficient electrical double layer, facilitating uniform Zn deposition and suppressing side reactions. Oxamide is identified as an optimal additive, enabling dendrite‐free and stable Zn cycling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nOrganic electrolyte additives have emerged as a promising strategy to regulate interfacial reactions at the Zn anode in aqueous batteries, yet their design remains largely empirical owing to a lack of molecular‐level understanding. In this work, a dual‐descriptor framework based on molecular polarizability and surface energy to guide the rational screening of electrolyte additives for stable Zn deposition is introduced. Systematic evaluation reveals that lower polarizability promotes the formation of a compact, water‐deficient electrical double layer (EDL), which enhances Zn2+ desolvation and promotes rapid nucleation with oriented growth. Meanwhile, a moderately high surface energy, particularly when closely matched with that of the ZnSO4 electrolyte, ensures stable interfacial adsorption and synergizes with low polarizability to achieve uniform Zn deposition. In contrast, excessively high surface energy induces additive aggregation, weakens EDL compactness, and leads to uneven deposition and parasitic side reactions. Guided by this dual‐descriptor screening framework, oxamide is identified as a representative additive featuring low polarizability and well‐matched surface energy. Its incorporation improves Zn deposition morphology, enhances coulombic efficiency, and delivers superior cycling stability in both half‐cell and Zn‐MnO2 full‐cell configurations. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of descriptor‐guided additive design and offers a molecular‐level strategy for advancing stable and high‐performance aqueous Zn‐ion batteries.",

Restructuring the inner Helmholtz plane enhances interfacial stability, and Ion–dipole interactions suppress the shuttle effect of polyiodide species. This approach enables Zn‐I2 battery with excellent capacity and high rate capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nAqueous Zn‐I2 batteries are promising for sustainable energy storage, exhibit excellent safety, low cost, and high energy density. However, their practical application is limited by the two‐electron I−/I⁰ redox reaction and the severe shuttle effect of polyiodide species. Here, a multifunctional ionic liquid, 1‐butyl‐3‐methylimidazolium bromide (BmimBr), is introduced to establish a dynamic interhalogen coupling between iodine and bromine species, which enables a six‐electron transfer pathway involving I−/I⁰/I⁺ and Br−/Br⁰. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations show that Br− acts as a dynamic mediator, forming an [IBr2]− intermediate with iodine. This significantly lowers the energy barrier for oxidizing I⁰ to I⁺, thereby contributing additional capacity and accelerating kinetics. Simultaneously, Bmim⁺ provides dual interfacial functions: confining polyiodides at the cathode to suppress shuttling, and forming a protective layer on the zinc anode, which reduces interfacial water, inhibits dendrite growth and side reactions. Leveraging this synergistic design, the Zn‐I2 battery achieves a high specific capacity of 511 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 and retains 90.22% of its capacity after 30 000 cycles at 10 A g−1. The dynamic interhalogen coupling strategy offers a novel route to activate multielectron reactions and stabilize electrode interfaces in Zn‐I2 batteries.",

It enlarges solvated clusters’ coverage and homogenizes ion concentration, promoting dense SEI nucleation via a mixed nucleation mechanism combining 2D instantaneous and 3D progressive steps, followed by 2D growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nSolid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with high uniformness is one of the essential approaches to improving the electrochemical performance of anode‐free zinc metal batteries. However, nonuniform solvation concentration and distribution at the interface lead to random SEI nucleation and uncontrolled growth, resulting in a low‐quality SEI morphology that thereby compromising the calendar life of the batteries. Herein, a uniform SEI is constructed through a strongly solvent‐weakly solvent competition strategy. The underlying evolution mechanism is elucidated that electron‐withdrawing oxygen of the weakly solvent with the amino hydrogen of dimethoxyethylamine competing manipulation driven a structural transition from ring‐serrated configurations to expanded linear architectures. This forms high‐density, anion‐aggregated solvation clusters at the substrate interface, enabling uniform nucleation and 2D growth of SEI. The optimized SEI facilitates spatially homogeneous Zn‐ion flux, thereby obtaining highly ordered Zn deposition and avoiding dendrites, minimizing the accumulated consumption of active zinc during long cycling. The Zn||VO2‐V2O5/NC cells achieve 13,000 stable cycles with limited zinc. The anode‐free zinc cells deliver exceptional cycle ability of 500 cycles with 99.82% average coulombic efficiency.",

In ZnSO4 aqueous solution, it demonstrated 507 mAh g−1at 50 mA g−1, together with a superior cyclability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nOrganic materials have attracted considerable attention as high‐performance cathodes for aqueous zinc‐ion batteries (AZIBs) owing to their structural tunability and molecular diversity. However, their capacities are typically limited (≤350 mAh g−1), primarily due to redox reactions involving the transfer of only a few electrons (≤4 electrons) per molecule. Here, the study designs and synthesizes a six‐electron‐transfer organic cathode material, 5,12‐dihydro‐1,5,7,8,12,14‐hexaazapentacene (DHHAP), by bridging water‐soluble pyridinediamine and hydroxybenzoquinone units. First‐principles calculations and in situ ATR‐FTIR spectroscopy confirm that four imine (C═N) groups and two amine (─NH─) groups serve as redox‐active sites, affording a high theoretical capacity of 562 mAh g−1. Electrochemical tests reveal that DHHAP delivers a remarkable discharge capacity of 507 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1—approaching the theoretical limit—and exhibits excellent cycling stability over 10 000 cycles at 10 A g−1. Moreover, it maintains outstanding rate capability and long‐term cycling performance even at high mass loadings (3–10 mg cm−2), underscoring its promise for practical applications in aqueous zinc‐ion batteries.",

    "abstract": "This study develops a diffusion‐regulating interphase enabled by organic thin films through layer‐by‐layer self‐assembly of chitosan and sodium alginate biomacromolecules on δ‐MnO2 nanoflowers. This approach induces the Mn2+ ↔ Mn3+ ↔ Mn4+ stepwise redox kinetics in MnO2 and enhances the integrity of the cathode via adsorption between the polar functional groups of the biomacromolecules and metal ions. This coating improves both capacity and cycling stability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nStructural degradation and rapid capacity decay of MnO2 cathodes significantly limit the battery lifespan of aqueous zinc‐ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, an ion‐enriched and multifunctional composite film is developed through a controllable and mature layer‐by‐layer (LbL) self‐assembly technique for stabilizing MnO2 cathodes. The multilayer consists of two bio‐macromolecules of chitosan (CS) and sodium alginate (SA). It is shown that this LbL film can optimize the ion distribution on the MnO2 cathode due to the presence of a large amount of polar functional groups. This can promote the Mn2+ ↔ Mn3+ ↔ Mn4+ two‐step redox process and the reversible deposition of Zn4(OH)6SO4·xH2O. It is also shown that the dissolved Mn2+ can be immobilized to prevent capacity decay. Full cells with the double layer of SA/CS exhibit maximum reversible capacity of 604.3 mAh g−1 at 0.3 A g−1. The cathode maintains the capacity retention of 86.96% after 1000 stable cycles at 2 A g−1. Given the facile and cost‐effective material and production of the LbL films, this cathode‐modified strategy may boost the industrial application of high‐capacity AZIBs.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchical molecular engineering of Zn anodes via alkylated silane quaternary ammonium salts synergizes hydrophobic shielding and cationic regulation to achieve ultra‐stable aqueous zinc batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nWater's Janus‐faced functionality as both an ion‐transport medium and parasitic‐electrochemistry instigator creates an irreconcilable interfacial dilemma for Zn anodes in aqueous electrolytes. Herein, a hierarchical optimization strategy is proposed, integrating dual collaborative mechanisms: hydrophobic shielding and cationic regulation, achieved by functionalizing Zn anodes with an alkylated silane‐based quaternary ammonium salt (Zn@SiONH+‐C18). The hydrophobic octadecyl chains suppress H2O‐induced corrosion and hydrogen evolution, while ─NH4+ groups enhance Zn2+ deposition kinetics via the electrostatic repulsion effect and anchor SO42‐ to mitigate passivation reaction. Simultaneously, the siloxane‐derived Si‐O‐Zn skeleton with cross‐linked Si‐O‐Si networks ensures mechanical robustness of the interface, fundamentally inhibiting dendrite formation. Consequently, the Zn@SiONH+‐C18 symmetric cells exhibit exceptional cycling over 3400 h (1 mA cm−2) and 2800 h (5 mA cm−2) at 1 mAh cm−2. Notably, the Zn@SiONH+‐C18 anode sustains 1000 h under a 55.6% depth of discharge (DOD, 10 mAh cm−2) and achieves a high DOD of 92% (16.6 mAh cm−2). When paired with a MnO2 cathode, the full battery retains 63.2% capacity after 10,000 cycles at 10C. This specific molecular‐layer engineering strategy, which simultaneously addresses dendrite suppression and interfacial stabilization, establishes a paradigm for developing sustainable aqueous metal batteries.",

The resulting copolymer coating exhibits elasticity, adhesion, and ion‐selective nanodomains, which lower Zn2+ desolvation barriers, guide deposition to the stable (002) facet, and ensure intimate interfacial contact, delivering over 32,000 stable cycles in symmetric Zn cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nThe development of stable zinc anodes is critical for advancing high‐rate, long‐life aqueous zinc batteries. Here a tape‐inspired anode modification is reported using a poly (methyl methacrylate)‐grafted natural rubber (NRAc) copolymer as a conformal protective coating. The microphase‐separated architecture integrates elastic, hydrophobic NR domains with Zn2+‐coordinating PMMA nanodomains, forming mechanically adaptive and ion‐selective channels. Density functional theory and microscopy reveal that Zn2+ preferentially binds to PMMA, lowering desolvation barriers and biasing deposition toward the stable (002) facet. This dual mechanical‐chemical regulation suppresses dendrite growth and parasitic hydrogen evolution, while maintaining intimate interfacial contact under dynamic cycling. As a result, NRAc@Zn symmetric cells achieve unprecedented cycling lifetimes exceeding 32,000 cycles, while Zn||V2O5 full cells deliver stable operation at current densities up to 10 A g−1. Scaling to a 1.5 Ah pouch cell demonstrates the practical feasibility of the approach.

This functional design enhances ionic conductivity and solvation stability in zinc‐ion batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe uncontrolled Zn2+ deposition on the surface of Zn metal anode remains a critical challenge in the development of zinc‐ion batteries (ZIBs). Here, a novel separator featuring negatively charged sulfonic acid groups (─SO3H) and strong hydrophilicity is reported to promote ion conduction and solvation stability. Through systematic experimental investigations and density functional theory, it is demonstrated that the water‐retaining effect of the ─SO3H group effectively suppresses side reactions and reduces the desolvation energy barrier, thereby establishing a hydrogen‐bond‐mediated ion transport channel. As a result, the Zn/Zn symmetric cells with sulfonated polyethersulfone (SPES) nanofiber separator demonstrate a long‐term stability over 4400 h under stepwise current densities of 0.5/2.5/4 mA cm−2.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nDue to the inherently insulating nature of MnO2, the performance of rechargeable alkaline Zn–MnO2 batteries is critically influenced by the conductive framework within the cathodes. Conventional approaches to achieving a percolating network in thick MnO2 cathodes typically involve either large quantities of low‐surface‐area graphite or employing high‐surface‐area carbon materials such as Ketjen black and graphene. However, these strategies present significant trade‐offs: excessive graphite reduces active material loading and energy density, while nanocarbons promote undesirable side reactions that compromise cycling stability. In this study, we introduce cost‐effective percolative graphite (PG) with moderate surface area as an effective conductive additive that balances conductivity and surface reactivity. The resulting electrodes, composed of commercial γ‐MnO2 and PG, deliver practical energy densities and superior cycling stability in conventional alkaline electrolytes at the pouch‐cell level. These findings underscore the importance of rational conductive network engineering and present guidance in developing high‐performance rechargeable Zn–MnO2 batteries for practical applications.",

An ideal Zn anode/electrolyte interface should combine a water‐poor environment with high Zn2+ conductivity. Herein, the non‐water‐induced Zn2+ conduction on the Zn surface during Zn2+ solvation/de‐solvation processes is promoted to enable sustainable aqueous Zn metal batteries. Specifically, a sequential bilayer of polydopamine and Nafion on the Zn metal anode established hydrophilic‐hydrophobic domains that promoted the reversible Zn2+ solvation processes. Simultaneously, this interfacial design created a water‐poor environment on the near Zn surface, while achieving a Zn2+ conductivity of 23.4 mS cm−1 and a record‐high transference number of 0.95. Consequently, highly reversible Zn plating/stripping are both achieved, and 91.1% of the corrosion side‐reaction is suppressed. Such a Zn anode demonstrated its success in a 102 mAh pouch cell with commercial MnO2 cathode, which exhibited a capacity retention of 96.7% with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.97% after 100 cycles at 1 C, outperforming the counterpart with commercial Zn anode (Capacity retention: 43.1%, CE: 99.12%).",

Through the synergistic optimization of BZPC, the Zn─I2 full cell achieves an ultralong lifespan and high‐rate performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAqueous zinc–iodine (Zn─I2) batteries demonstrate immense potential for energy storage owing to their inherent safety, stable voltage plateau, and environmental friendliness. However, the slow iodine conversion, polyiodide shuttle effect, and uncontrollable Zn dendrites impede the improvement of their performance. Herein, we successfully designed a bifunctional core–shell host derived from BiHCF@ZIF‐8, which consists of a porous carbon matrix encapsulating abundant metal catalytic sites and trace N‐doping (BZPC). This superior multi‐site co‐doped hierarchical porous structure can serve as a high‐efficiency iodine carrier to effectively confine iodine species and enhance their conversion kinetics. Simultaneously, the BZPC can also be applied as a functional modification layer to induce uniform Zn deposition, thereby achieving a dendrite‐free Zn anode. The assembled Zn//BZPC@I2 batteries and BZPC@Zn symmetric cells can operate stably at ultrahigh current densities of 50 C and 100 mA cm−2, respectively. Through a synergistic optimization strategy of “one host for dual purposes”, the BZPC@Zn//BZPC@I2 batteries achieve an ultralong lifespan of 28 000 stable cycles even at an ultrahigh current density of 50 C. This study not only pioneers the difunctional BZPC for both iodine host design and zinc interface engineering but also establishes an innovative and scalable strategy for developing long‐life and high‐rate Zn─I2 batteries.",

    "abstract": "This study demonstrates the first in situ application of grazing incidence X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (GI‐XAS) to probe interfacial degradation in MnO2 cathodes of zinc‐ion batteries. By varying the incidence angle, surface‐ and bulk‐specific redox changes are revealed, highlighting Mn dissolution and incomplete reoxidation as key factors driving capacity fading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nDespite such assets as intrinsic safety and low cost, the performance of zinc‐ion batteries (ZIBs) is hindered by interfacial processes that occur at the cathode. Because of capacity fading and poor rate capability, manganese dioxide (MnO2) cathodes are also negatively affected. Here, the novel application of in situ grazing incidence x‐ray absorption spectroscopy (GI‐XAS) to investigate the cathode‐electrolyte interfacial dynamics in a MnO2 cathode ZIB is demonstrated. By using a low‐incidence angle X‐ray beam to selectively probe the cathode surface, in situ changes are captured in the MnO2 oxidation state and local structure during charge–discharge. Results reveal that MnO2 undergoes a dissolution‐redeposition mechanism at the interface. During discharge, Mn4+ is reduced to Mn3+ and further to Mn2+ species that migrate into the electrolyte. Whilst charging, these Mn2+ species form a transient Mn2+‐rich layer on the cathode surface. This surface layer impedes Zn2+ transport and causes increased overpotential, correlating with capacity decay. Such interfacial transformations are fully reversible in the bulk of the cathode but only partially reversible at the surface, thus leading to residual Mn2+/ Mn3+ species after recharge. The findings provide direct evidence of cathode surface reconstruction as a potent contributor to performance degradation.",
